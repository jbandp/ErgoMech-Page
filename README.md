# Ergomech Landing Page

Repo for the app of the [site](https://buildergomech.netlify.app).

## Purpose

Template for Ergomech (Ergonomic Mechanical Keyboard) building website. Users will select a base variant that will be comprised of
similarly shaped cases, but will contain varying amounts of keys. Though QMK, 46 keys is plenty, many will feel more confident being closer to the
107 standard. The size of the gaps between the keys also differs where tight has near-zero and others are island-style. There are 12 total combinations in total.
In addition, a user can send their own stl files and they will be printed instead.

All the parts, soldering, and assembly can be done at additional price. The primary feature is to provide a custom keymap for just 99 USD, which can
easily save a dozen hours even for someone already experienced in writing C.
